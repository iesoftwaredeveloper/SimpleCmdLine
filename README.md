# SimpleCmdLine

## What is My Project?

This is a sample .NET 5 application that is intended to demonstrate System.CommandLine and how to use it.

## Getting Started

You can get your own copy of the source by forking the project located at https://github.com/iesoftwaredeveloper/SimpleCmdLine.

If you just want to read the code you can review the [main branch](https://github.com/iesoftwaredeveloper/SimpleCmdLine/tree/main) and see the most recent version.

Or you can review the code as it was at various stages of development by reviewing the [tags](https://github.com/iesoftwaredeveloper/SimpleCmdLine/tags) on the project.  These generally follow the progress of the application as I add to the project.
